**Overview**
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to analyze public sentiment on climate change based on user comments collected from NASA's Facebook page. The dataset includes over 500 comments from high-engagement posts between 2020 and 2023, offering insights into public opinion and engagement related to climate change.

**Project Description**
In this project, I explored various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze public discourse on climate change. The dataset consists of user comments with features such as date, number of likes, and comment text, providing a foundation for sentiment analysis, trend analysis, and topic modeling.

**By using machine learning techniques, the project aims to:**

1.Classify public sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
2.Identify trends in public opinion about climate change over time.
3.Discover key themes in the conversation through topic modeling.
4.Analyze engagement metrics, such as likes and responses, to understand the impact of different posts.
